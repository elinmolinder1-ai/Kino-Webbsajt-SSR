# Kino_Webbsajt
The assignment involves planning, structuring, and initiating the development of a cinema website in a group, following Scrum methodology. GitHub Kanban Projects are used as the project management tool.
The project begins with wireframes to define the structure of the website. Based on these, epics are created and then broken down into Product Backlog Items (PBIs).
Once a collection of PBIs is established, sprint planning is conducted. The first sprint runs for a maximum of two weeks (equivalent to ten working days due to holidays).
The planning process also includes Planning Poker for effort estimation.
